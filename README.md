This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on health parameters. With diabetes becoming a widespread concern globally, this model aims to assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis, enabling preventive measures and personalized treatment planning.

# Details about the dataset
The datasets consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome. Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so on.

Dataset: The PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset is used, containing medical measurements like glucose levels, insulin levels, BMI, etc.

Approach: Several machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Perceptron, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors) were implemented and evaluated.
